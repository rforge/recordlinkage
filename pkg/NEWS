Changes in version 0.3-1
	- fixed bug in emClassify that threw an error during  classification 
	  with on-the-fly calculation of weights
	- added checks in unit tests
	- fixed bug in optimalThreshold which caused wrong results in some
	  cases when ny was supplied
	- added status messages and progress bars to various classification functions
	- fixed numerical problem that produced wrong thresholds in some cases
    for emClassify (with my / ny supplied) 

Changes in version 0.3-0

	- A framework of S4 methods and classes tailored for processing large
	  data sets has been added. See the vignette 'BigData' for details.
  	- The output format of getPairs (existing method for RecLinkData and
	  RecLinkResult objects) has changed: Column "Weight" is now last instead
	  of first. Also, for single.rows=FALSE, record pairs are speparated by
	  a blank line.

Changes in version 0.2-6

	- added subset operator [ for RecLinkData and RecLinkPairs objects
	- improved running time of epiWeights significantly

Changes in version 0.2-5

	- Fixed a bug in getMinimalTrain which caused the function to fail

Changes in version 0.2-4

	- Fixed a bug in getMinimalTrain that caused pairs with unknown
		matching status to become non-matches in the training set.
	- Some examples were modified to reduce execution time.
	- Unit tests have been added in inst/unitTests.
	- Checking of arguments improved in some functions.
	- Small documentation changes.
Changes in version 0.2-3

  - getParetoThreshold now prompts a message if no data lies in the
    interactively selected interval and asks the user to choose again
  - Corrected maintainer e-mail address
  - Several bug fixes
